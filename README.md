# Light-Pulse

✨ Light-Pulse is an interactive playground where visuals and sound react to your cursor.  
Move around inside the pad box to paint it with colors and shape the tones in real-time.

## 🎮 What you can do
- Watch the pad box light up with shifting colors as you move your mouse.
- Play with sound that changes pitch and volume depending on where the cursor goes.
- Toggle the sound **On / Off** with a single button (colors always stay active).
